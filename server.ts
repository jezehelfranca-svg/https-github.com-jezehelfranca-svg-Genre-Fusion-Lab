CREATIVE CATALYST (a secret origin spark for this fusion): ${catalyst}.
CREATIVITY DIRECTIVE: ${modeConfig.directive}

TRACKLIST SEED DIRECTIVE:
To keep the track titles grounded, legendary, and metaphorically rich (strictly avoiding cheesy, silly, or overly-literal titles), you MUST base your 3 EP track titles on this dynamically shuffled and randomized subset of iconic metaphorical song seeds:
${shuffledSeeds.map(t => `"${t}"`).join(', ')}

For your Fictional EP Tracklist below (Track 1, Track 2, and Track 3):
1. **Semantic Selection**: You can semantically choose titles directly from the randomized seed list above that perfectly align with the vibe, atmospheric mood, and narrative of your newly fused genre.
2. **Creative Hybridization**: Alternatively, you can creatively generate brand new, hybridized titles by blending, recombining, or poeticizing elements of those randomized seeds (e.g., merging "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and "Tomorrow Never Knows" into "Tomorrow in the Sky with Diamonds", or mutating "Strawberry Fields Forever" into "Strawberry Rain Forever").
Either way, the titles must remain highly evocative and metaphorical. For each track, write a beautiful, poetic song story (Story & Context) inspired by or translating that title's metaphorical essence into your newly fused genre.

NAMING RULES: The genre name must be a striking invented word or an unexpected two-word collision. NEVER simply concatenate the input genre names, and avoid overused prefixes like "Cyber-", "Neo-" or "Synth-" unless truly earned by the concept.

Describe the resulting fusion in Markdown format.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The top-level heading, introduction, and "### Genre DNA" section combined MUST ALWAYS be strictly up to 1000 characters in total length. Keep each field extremely concise, poetic, but dense and under the limit.

Structure the beginning of your response exactly like this:
# [Catchy Genre Name]

### Genre DNA
- **Genre Identity:** [Concise sound/sonic synthesis description grafting the input elements, in exactly one sentence]
- **Creative Catalyst:** [In exactly one short evocative sentence, restate the catalyst: ${catalyst}]
- **Rhythmic Synthesis:** [Exactly one sentence describing the rhythmic synthesis framework]
- **Pulse Mechanics:** [Exactly one sentence describing pulse mechanics and rhythmic feel]
- **BPM/Tempo:** [Exactly one sentence describing BPM/Tempo oscillation or range]
- **Harmonics:** [Exactly one sentence describing scales, chord clusters, tonal colors, or detuning effects]
- **Thermal Gating:** [Exactly one sentence describing side-chain/gating/modulation signature]
- **Granular Decay:** [Exactly one sentence describing granular or texturing decay signature]
- **Sub-Bass Sublimation:** [Exactly one sentence describing somatic/equilibrium low-end bass details]
- **Macro Dynamics:** [Exactly one sentence describing structural dynamic contrast or how tracks breathe]

Following the "### Genre DNA" section, include:
- A section titled "### Scene & Origin Lore" with one vivid paragraph about where, when, and by whom this genre came alive — its subculture, fashion, and rituals, shaped by the Creative Catalyst.
- The typical instruments used (ensure any selected instruments/synths from the seeds are featured as central to the sonic signature).
- A line formatted as: **For Fans Of:** [3-4 real artists or acts that bridge listeners into this fictional genre]
- **Fictional Band Name:** [Provide band name here]
- **Band Description:** [Provide a rich description of this band, their members, aesthetic style, and how they play this new genre]
- **Band Visual & Press Photoshoot Prompt:** [A highly descriptive, artistic, cinematic image prompt representing the band members, their costumes, style, instruments, or general visual performance vibe, suitable for professional press release photos or band posters]
- A descriptive mood or vibe.

In addition, you MUST first brainstorm and suggest exactly 3 to 5 'new' creative song titles that semantically align with the synthesized genre's vibe, instruments, and atmospheric elements. These should be generated by combining, hybridizing, or adapting elements of the 400+ provided iconic metaphorical song titles (or creatively building metaphorical titles inspired by them).
Include this as a section with the exact title:
### Suggested Creative Song Titles
Format each item exactly like this:
- **[Suggested Title]**: [Brief explanation of how this title is brainstormed, its semantic alignment with the genre's vibe, and the metaphor or seed title it was inspired by]

Immediately following the brainstorming section, you MUST create the Fictional EP Tracklist consisting of exactly 3 different iconic tracks of this new genre. 
**Crucial Constraint**: You MUST select exactly 3 of the brainstormed titles from the '### Suggested Creative Song Titles' section above as the track titles for your tracklist.
Each track MUST follow this strict structural formatting so it can be parsed cleanly:
### Fictional EP Tracklist
---
#### Track 1: [Chosen Brainstormed Title 1]
- **Story & Context:** [Creative context, lyrics description, or narrative story of how the song was conceived]
- **Visual & Lyrics Prompt:** [A highly descriptive, artistic, poetic image prompt representing the song's lyric/vibe, suitable for generating a stunning album artwork or lyric video background]

#### Track 2: [Chosen Brainstormed Title 2]
- **Story & Context:** [Creative context, lyrics description, or narrative story of how the song was conceived]
- **Visual & Lyrics Prompt:** [A highly descriptive, artistic, poetic image prompt representing the song's lyric/vibe, suitable for generating a stunning album artwork or lyric video background]

#### Track 3: [Chosen Brainstormed Title 3]
- **Story & Context:** [Creative context, lyrics description, or narrative story of how the song was conceived]
- **Visual & Lyrics Prompt:** [A highly descriptive, artistic, poetic image prompt representing the song's lyric/vibe, suitable for generating a stunning album artwork or lyric video background]

Near the end of your response, you MUST include a section with the exact title:
### Consolidated Brief Summary
Followed by a single-paragraph brief description consolidating everything generated, using a comma to separate each dimension and value. For example:
"Genre: Blues-Wave, Sound: Electro-acoustic slide guitar with synth bass, Central Instruments: Hohner Clavinet and Roland TR-808, Fictional Band: Neon Muddy, Debut Track: Voltage River, Vibe: Swampy atmospheric cyber-blues"

Finally, you MUST end the response with one last section with the exact title:
### Suno Style Prompt
Followed by ONE single plain-text paragraph of AT MOST 950 characters (strictly under 1000). This paragraph gets pasted directly into the "Style of Music" field of AI music generators like Suno, so it must obey these rules:
- Distill the Genre DNA above (tempo/BPM, harmonic palette, production signatures, dynamics) plus the central instruments, mood, and vocal style into flowing comma-separated descriptor phrases.
- Plain text only: no markdown, no asterisks, no headings, no quotes, no line breaks inside the paragraph.
- NEVER mention real artist or band names (music generators reject them) — describe the sound itself instead.
- Every word must earn its place: concrete sonic adjectives and playable directions, not generic hype.
Example of the expected format: "dark gothic Cuban trova fusion, 96 BPM habanera pulse against rigid drum machine eighths, D minor Phrygian bolero cadences, lush detuned analog chorus synth pads, nylon-string guitar with tape flutter, whispered female close-harmony verses blooming into cathedral-reverb choruses, subterranean 1980s production, melancholic and ritualistic"

Keep it imaginative but format it nicely. Use headings, bullet points, and bold text.`;

You MUST customize your recommendation by selecting exactly 2 to 4 items from the official inventory of available elements below. It is highly recommended to select a mixture of Base Genres, Moods, and Instruments:

OFFICIAL BASE GENRES:

OFFICIAL MOODS & VIBES:

OFFICIAL INSTRUMENTS & SYNTHS:

Guidelines:
1. Explain passionately but clearly why this particular recipe works for their requested intention. Use vivid, poetic, and professional musical descriptions.
2. Structure your recommendations with elegant Markdown headings, lists, and bold highlights.
3. At the very end of your response, you MUST enclose the exact items you recommended inside a matching recipe tag so the user interface can parse them and let them load the recipe in one-click.
The recipe block must be formatted EXACTLY like this (using the exact strings from the official lists above, case-sensitive, separated by a pipe "|" character):
[RECIPE: Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3]

Example: If you recommend "AMAPIANO", "432Hz RELAXING MEDITATIVE STYLES", and "CALM PLANET SCENE (AMBIENT SCAPE)", the tag at the end should be:
[RECIPE: AMAPIANO | 432Hz RELAXING MEDITATIVE STYLES | CALM PLANET SCENE (AMBIENT SCAPE)]
